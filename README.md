# Solar-Tracking-System
This project creates a dual-axis solar tracking system using Arduino UNO to automatically rotate a solar panel toward the strongest light source. It uses two LDR sensors for detecting sunlight intensity, a servo motor for panel movement, and a small solar panel for demonstration. Supporting components include 10kΩ resistors, jumper wires, a breadboard, and a mounting frame. The Arduino compares LDR values and adjusts the servo to keep the panel aligned with sunlight. This improves energy efficiency and can be expanded to a four-axis system for more precise tracking. The setup is simple, low-cost, and ideal for student or DIY renewable-energy projects.
