# Solar-Tracking-System
Solar Tracking System is designed to enhance solar panel efficiency by continuously aligning with the sun’s position.
It uses LDR sensors to detect sunlight intensity and servo motors to adjust the panel’s orientation in real time.
The L298N motor driver enables precise and reliable motor control for smooth movement.
The system is battery-powered, ensuring autonomous and energy-efficient operation.
This project demonstrates practical implementation of automation, sensor integration, and renewable energy optimization.
